# ComputerVision-Ares

## Strategy used to implement the concepts marked
Initially, i thought to learn OpenCV from scratch like learning each and everything but after spending ample amount of time i figured out that i shall not to be able to complete it on time so i take the suggested title and start working on them learning each and every thing came to my way from cv2.add to cv2.waitKey give a deep insight of OpenCV 

## What you learnt in the process
while starting working on this process i have basic knowledge of OpenCV as i spent alot of time installing right version of OpenCV for my tutorial but during this challenge i learnt alot from the process like what is actually meant by smoothening of image and how to perform geometrical operations and after learning alot of things i get the idea that it is not difficult its just needs attention which is however needed in learning anything
